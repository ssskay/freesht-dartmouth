# Free Stuff at Dartmouth


If you work at DALI: This coding sample is the biggest ongoing coding project that I am working on right now and 
used it as a way to teach myself web development prior to taking CS 52. I've tried to apply what I've learned in the class,
most notably learning how to use Bootstrap and Jekyll to design the page. I wanted to create something big and ambitious
that I think could really help the Dartmouth community, while also using it as practice for my coding skills.
